### Use Case Posts
```
💬 Building a customer support chatbot?

Don't route EVERY message to GPT-4.

With AI Task Router:
• 90% of questions → AI Badgr ($0.003/1K)
• 10% complex issues → GPT-4 ($0.03/1K)

1M messages/month: $270 instead of $3,000

That's $32,760 saved per year 💰

```
👨‍💻 Using Continue, Cursor, or Cline?

Save 80% on AI costs by routing through AI Task Router:

• Simple code → AI Badgr (fast & cheap)
• Complex refactoring → Claude (quality)
• Automatic fallback if rate limited

Drop-in OpenAI replacement.

Excited to announce AI Task Router - an open-source solution for intelligent LLM routing! 🚀

The Challenge:
Most AI applications waste money by routing all requests to expensive providers like GPT-4, even for simple tasks that could be handled by more cost-effective models.

The Solution:
AI Task Router intelligently distributes your AI requests across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, AI Badgr) based on task complexity:

✅ 80%+ cost savings through smart routing
✅ Automatic fallback handling for reliability
✅ Built-in cost tracking and monitoring
✅ OpenAI-compatible API
✅ Full TypeScript support

Real-world impact:
A chatbot handling 1M requests/month could save $27,000 monthly by using intelligent routing instead of defaulting to premium providers for everything.

Perfect for:
• AI Agents & Assistants
• Customer Support Chatbots
• Workflow Automation (n8n, Flowise)
• Developer Tools (Continue, Cursor)
• Data Processing Pipelines

Key Features:
🎯 Task-based routing
💰 Cost optimization
🔄 Automatic failover
📊 Real-time cost tracking
🚀 Zero configuration
📡 Streaming support
🔒 Type-safe TypeScript

Open source (MIT licensed) and available on NPM:
npm install @aibadgr/ai-task-router

Title: [P] AI Task Router - Open-source intelligent LLM routing for cost optimization

I built an open-source library that intelligently routes LLM requests across multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, AI Badgr) to optimize costs while maintaining quality.

**The Problem:**
Most AI apps route everything to GPT-4, even simple tasks that could use cheaper models. This wastes 80%+ on API costs.

**The Solution:**
AI Task Router automatically routes requests based on task complexity:
- Simple chat → AI Badgr ($0.003/1K tokens)
- Complex reasoning → GPT-4 ($0.03/1K tokens)
- Code tasks → Claude ($0.015/1K tokens)

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent task-based routing
- Automatic fallback for rate limits/errors
- Built-in cost tracking per request
- OpenAI-compatible API
- Full TypeScript support
- Streaming responses

**Real-world Savings:**
A chatbot with 1M requests/month: $270 instead of $3,000 ($32,760/year savings)

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install @aibadgr/ai-task-router
```

**GitHub:** https://github.com/michaelbrinkworth/ai-task-router

MIT licensed, fully tested, production-ready.

- Complex → Premium (GPT-4/Claude)
- Automatic fallback if errors

**Benefits:**
✅ 80%+ cost savings
✅ Never down (automatic failover)
✅ Cost tracking built-in
✅ Works with existing OpenAI tools

**Example savings:**
1M chatbot messages/month: $270 vs $3,000 (90% savings)

Title: AI Task Router – Intelligent LLM routing for cost optimization

URL: https://github.com/michaelbrinkworth/ai-task-router

---

Hey HN! I built an open-source library that intelligently routes LLM requests across multiple providers to optimize costs.

The idea came from building AI chatbots and realizing we were wasting money routing simple questions to GPT-4 when cheaper models would work fine.

AI Task Router automatically routes by task complexity:
- Simple chat → AI Badgr ($0.003/1K tokens)
- Complex reasoning → GPT-4 ($0.03/1K tokens)  
- Code generation → Claude ($0.015/1K tokens)

Key features:
- Automatic fallback (rate limits, timeouts, errors)
- Built-in cost tracking per request
- OpenAI-compatible (works with Continue, Cursor, etc.)
- TypeScript with streaming support
- Zero config to start

Real-world impact: A chatbot with 1M messages/month saves $27,000/month vs routing everything to GPT-4.

It's MIT licensed, well-tested, and production-ready. Would love feedback from the community!
